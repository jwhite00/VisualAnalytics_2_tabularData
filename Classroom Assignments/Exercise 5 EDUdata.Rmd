```{r getData, eval=FALSE}


link='https://github.com/EvansDataScience/VisualAnalytics_2_tabularData/raw/master/data/eduwa.rda'
load(file=url(link))

library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

eduwa4=eduwa[complete.cases(eduwa$Student.Teacher.Ratio),]


```



### Measurement


```{r histMeans, eval=FALSE}
# keeping strategy 2: 
meanValues=tapply(eduwa4$Student.Teacher.Ratio, 
                  eduwa4$County, 
                  mean)
hist(meanValues)
```

Let's compute some statistics:
```{r summaryMeans, eval=FALSE}
summary(meanValues)
```

You can use that info, for example, to plot the mean as a reference line:

```{r plotMeans, eval=FALSE}
#reference line
hist(meanValues)
abline(v=mean(meanValues),lty=3,lwd=3,col='blue')
```

Measurements are continuous values, then a **density** plot is more appealing to its nature:

```{r density, eval=FALSE}

mvDense=density(meanValues)

plot(mvDense,main="Title",col='black',xlab=NA)

abline(v=mean(meanValues),lty=3,lwd=3,col='blue') #mean
abline(v=median(meanValues),lty=3,lwd=3,col='red')#median
legend(x="right",
       legend=c('mean','median'),
       fill = c('blue','red'),bty = 'n') #no box in the legend
```

A box plot is always welcome, specially considering that it does not need reference lines. Take a look:
```{r bixplotMeasurement,eval=FALSE}

bp=boxplot(meanValues,horizontal = T,ylim=c(5,30), main = "Quartile Distribution of Student-Teacher Ratio" , 
           xlab = 'Student-Teacher Ratio')

abline(v=mean(meanValues),lty=3,lwd=3,col='blue') #mean
abline(v=median(meanValues),lty=3,lwd=3,col='red')#median

legend(x="right",
       legend=c('mean','median'),
       fill = c('blue','red'),bty = 'n') #no box in the legend


```

Our plots for the mean values have a more symmetrical shape. This happens when you get mean values of groups, showing a tendency towards a bell-shaped distribution, which is ideally known as the _Gauss_ or _Normal_  distribution.

Notice also that boxplots serve to detect **atypical** values (outliers), which I saved in _bp_: 
```{r outliers, eval=FALSE}
bp$out
```

We could annotate the boxplot like this:
```{r boxplt_annotate, eval=FALSE}

boxplot(meanValues,horizontal = T,ylim=c(5,30))
text(x= 10, y= 0.8, labels= "Outliers are:",col='gray')
text(x= 10, y= 0.75, 
     labels= paste(names(bp$out)[1], 'and', names(bp$out)[2]),
     col='gray')
```

In general, measurements and counts are prone to have outliers. It is not common to speak about outliers in categorical data since they have few levels; however, if they had many levels, we could find outliers if the variable is ordinal.

From what I said above, the subjective side of finding outliers lies in the decision of **what is normal**. In the case of the boxplot, the decision has been to accept as normal the values that have a *prudent distance* from the first or last quartile. This distance is 1.5 times the difference between the quartiles (a.k.a. Interquartle Range or **IQR**). Then, if a outlier is found, the whisker ends in a position different than the actual minimum or maximal value of the data.


```{r}

base = ggplot(eduwa4, aes(x = 'meanValues'))  
plot1 = base + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10,boundary=0)
plot2 = plot1 + stat_bin(binwidth = 10, aes(label=..count..), 
                  geom = "text",boundary = 0,vjust=-0.5)
plot2




```


```{r}
base= ggplot(eduwa3,aes(x = Reduced.Lunch))  
h1= base + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10,boundary=0) #changing width
h1= h1 + stat_bin(binwidth = 10, aes(label=..count..), 
                  geom = "text",boundary = 0,vjust=-0.5)
h1

```
