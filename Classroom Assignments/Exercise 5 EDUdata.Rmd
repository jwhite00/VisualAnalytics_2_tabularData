### Measurement


```{r histMeans, eval=FALSE}
eduwa4=eduwa[complete.cases(eduwa$Student.Teacher.Ratio),]
# keeping strategy 2: 
meanValues=tapply(eduwa4$Student.Teacher.Ratio, 
                  eduwa4$County, 
                  mean)

df=as.data.frame(meanValues)
df$county = rownames(df)
```



In general, measurements and counts are prone to have outliers. It is not common to speak about outliers in categorical data since they have few levels; however, if they had many levels, we could find outliers if the variable is ordinal.

From what I said above, the subjective side of finding outliers lies in the decision of **what is normal**. In the case of the boxplot, the decision has been to accept as normal the values that have a *prudent distance* from the first or last quartile. This distance is 1.5 times the difference between the quartiles (a.k.a. Interquartle Range or **IQR**). Then, if a outlier is found, the whisker ends in a position different than the actual minimum or maximal value of the data.


```{r}

base = ggplot(eduwa4, aes(x = 'meanValues'))  
plot1 = base + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10,boundary=0)
plot2 = plot1 + stat_bin(binwidth = 10, aes(label=..count..), 
                  geom = "text",boundary = 0,vjust=-0.5)
plot2




```


```{r}
base= ggplot(eduwa3,aes(x = Reduced.Lunch))  
h1= base + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10,boundary=0) #changing width
h1= h1 + stat_bin(binwidth = 10, aes(label=..count..), 
                  geom = "text",boundary = 0,vjust=-0.5)
h1

```
